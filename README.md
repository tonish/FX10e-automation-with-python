# FX10e-automation-with-python

FX10e is a hyperspectral camera by Specim. 
It comes with 2 GUI softwares and no API.

To make it work in an autonomus way, you have to be able to adjust several parameters before you start taking images. 
It's tedios, but if you use autoit, and you know your experiment, the hard work is allready established in the code. 
Just change a few parameters and follow https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/9/1493 for more info.
